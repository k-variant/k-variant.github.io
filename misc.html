        A story I've grown to accept will likely never be finished; I've completely and utterly stopped working on it, for many personal reasons.
        Nevertheless, if you get something out of the smidge I've mustered the courage to put here, please do let me know!
        I'll be deeply grateful, and may even press on if there's enough meaningful interest from even one person.
        Regardless, I plan to release more of what I've done so far the more and more jaded I become with life.
        There's three finished chapters, three more half-done chapters, and there once was a plan for many more.
